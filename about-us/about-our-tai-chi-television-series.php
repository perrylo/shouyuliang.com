The show, simply named <i><b>Tai Chi</b></i>, premiered June 30, 2003 on Channel M, and has proven to be extremely popular.  The series has since been picked up by stations across Canada and the United States.</p>
					<p>The show, planned and written entirely by Helen and Grandmaster Liang and hosted by Helen, teaches the complete international standard Tai Chi 24 Form along with various health maintenance Qigong (Chinese meditation) methods.  The second season expands on the instruction with the Tai Chi 48 Form set.</p>

						<h2>Requests for Tai Chi on DVD/VHS</h2>
						<b>Tai Chi</b> with Grandmaster Shou-Yu Liang is currently not yet available for retail.  The latest information on this will be posted on <b><i>ShouyuLiang.com</i></b> as we receive it.  Viewers may otherwise be interested in obtaining Grandmaster Liang's <a href="/dvd/simplified-tai-chi-chuan-with-applications.php"><b>Simplified Tai Chi instructional DVD</b></a> - which teaches the same 24 Form and 48 Form Tai Chi as the show.<br />
						<br />
						<h2>Show Schedule and Movement Reference</h2>
						As <b>Tai Chi</b> airs on so many networks across North America, it would impossible for us to keep a schedule of the episodes for any given area.  If you are looking for a reference for the movements and Grandmaster Liang's instruction, you should obtain a copy of his book <a href="/book/tai-chi-chuan-24-and-48-postures-with-martial-applications.php"><b>Tai Chi Chuan</b></a>, which describes in detail both the 24 and 48 Tai Chi forms that we teach on the show.

					<p>Filmed locally in Vancouver at the surreally beautiful Dr. Sun-Yat Sen Classical Chinese Gardens and at Chanel M studios, Helen and her father spent many weeks filming over 130 half-hour episodes for the show.  Several instructors from the Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute also appear on the series demonstrating other Tai Chi and various martial art styles.</p>
					<p>While the styles and instruction are rooted in Chinese traditional martial arts, Tai Chi has proven to attract a wide audience with its contemporary presentation and unique topics.  Many of the crew on this project have also worked in televising professional sports.  This original series has also been nominated for several Leo Awards, namely Best Lifestyle Series, Best Direction, and Best Host.</p>
					<p>The Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute, Helen Liang, and Grandmaster Liang would like to extend their thanks to all the crew that worked on Tai Chi.  We wish you all the best and hope to train with you again in the future!</p>
