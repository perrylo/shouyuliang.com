					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<br>
					<h3>1) I am interested in joining a class at your school.  Would it be possible for me to come and watch a class?</h3>
					<p>Of course!  All interested students are not only welcome to come and watch but also to participate in a class before deciding to join (Wushu class only).  That way, you'd be able to experience the informal social atmosphere at our school as well as meet the instructors, other students, and Grandmaster Shou-Yu Liang.  If you do attend, be sure to inform Grandmaster Liang that you are participating on a referral from the web site. Upon arrival at our school, please see or have someone direct you to an instructor for more information.</p>
					<h3>2) I have children that would like to learn martial arts.  What style is appropriate and when should they begin?</h3>
					<p>Wushu is traditionally the starting point for all of our younger students.  It is great exercise and builds a solid foundation for any other sports they may wish to learn later on.  Each class consists of stretching, drills, and routines to develop power, balance, agility, and flexibility.  The starting age for a child really depends on his or her ability and inclination.  We have had students starting as young as 5.  It would be best for you to bring your children to try a class and meet Grandmaster Liang.  Afterwards, you'll have a better idea of whether or not its a good time for your kids to start.</p>
					<h3>3) What should I bring to my first class?</h3>
					<p>You don't need to bring anything special to attend.  Just wear some comfortable exercise clothes, and perhaps have something to drink.  If you are attending an internal style class, you may wish to bring a pen and some paper to jot down some notes as Grandmaster Liang teaches theory.Â Upon arrival at our school, please see or have someone direct you to an instructor for more information.</p>
					<h3>4) I have never learned martial arts before.  What style should I start with?</h3>
					<p>This question can only really be answered by you.  As all the styles we teach are unique, you need to determine what appeals to you most - internal or external, exercise or self-defense, fast or slow.  Wushu is an excellent way to build a strong foundation for all styles.  However, if you have any health issues, you may wish to consider an internal style such as Taiji or Qigong.  Come to our school to experience a class and speak to Grandmaster Liang so that he may assess your situation.  As with all training routines, you should consult your doctor before starting.</p>
					<h3>5) How much do your classes cost and when are they scheduled?</h3>
					<p>Please view our full <a href="../../syl/when-are-classes.shtml">class schedule and fees</a> online.</p>
					<h3>6) Where is your school located?</h3>
					<p>The Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Our address is 220 Jackson Street, just a few blocks east of Main between Cordova and Powell.  We're on the 2nd floor of the Japanese Vancouver Buddhist Church.  Please enter off the alley (side entrance) and go upstairs.</p>
					<h3>7) I currently live abroad and am interested in coming to Vancouver to train at your school.  Would it be possible to set up a personal training session with Grandmaster Liang?</h3>
					<p>With all the requests that our school receives from around the world, it would be impossible for us to fulfill them all.  The demand for Grandmaster Liang's expertise is quite large.  You are definitely welcome to submit a request for special training via email but we cannot guarantee his availability.  If you interested in learning from him and your time is limited, we suggest that you try to attend one of his many workshops during spring, summer, and fall.</p>
