		<p>The <b>Shou-Yu Liang (SYL) Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute</b> teaches Chinese martial arts in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and promotes health and healing through exercise, stretching, meditation, and diet. Our school, formally established in 1987, stemmed from Wushu, Tai Chi, and Qigong classes originally taught by Grandmaster Shou-Yu Liang at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the North American Taiji Association.</p>
		<p>Our school and its students have been involved in countless national and international competitions and demonstrations.  We are the home and host of many Chinese martial arts champions.  All of our instructors have competition experience in both judging and competing (some having won many gold medals) and have been featured on television and in magazines.</p>
		<p>Our purpose is to increase the awareness and understanding of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Chinese Martial Arts.  To that end, our school aims at fostering the growth of our students both physically and spiritually with both external and internal martial arts styles.  Grandmaster Liang has published several highly popular books and videos that teach philosophy as well as technique, and we have created two television series teaching Tai Chi to the world.</p>
		<p>We welcome all visitors and new students to our school.  <a href="../../pdf/SYL_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Download our school brochure.</a></p>
