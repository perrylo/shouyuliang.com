				    <a href="/classes/wuji-xiao-yao-class.php"><b>Wuji Xiao Yao System - Wuji
					</b></a><br />
				    Wuji is an ancient internal martial art form long veiled in mystery. A great number
					of people have long heard of; few, however, have ever seen it, and an even fewer
					have had a mastery over it. Wuji means no extreme. It is before Tai Chi, the grand
					ultimate. The entire form of Wuji depicts a vivid story that embodies profound
					 Taoist and Buddhist philosophies; it is about how we cultivate our ‘original spirit’
					following the course of the cosmos and harmonizing with the myriad of changes
					of the universe. The physical movements and training express the ancient Taoist
					physical form and its many applications as well as having an in depth
					understanding of the theories and philosophies of this art. Grandmaster Liang
					 had performed Wuji in China 30 years ago. In 1985, he had again performed this
					form at the First International Wushu Invitational Competition held in China.
					Anyone interested in martial arts, Qigong or Taoist and Buddhist philosophies will
					find Wujiquan unique and fascinating. Beginner and advanced practitioners are all
					welcome to attend. The system integrates the essence of soft and hard Qigong,
					 it also emphasizes the cultivation of Qi, light, and spirit with the goal of
					reaching enlightenment.

					</b></a><br />
					Liu He Ba Fa literally means Six Harmonies and Eight Principles. It utilizes the power of Xingyi as its center, utilizes the stepping patterns of Bagua for its turning and spinning, and utilizes the neutralizing power of Taiji for its variations. Its movements are sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. These movements resemble that of floating clouds, and flowing water that is sometimes calm, sometimes surging. Therefore, it is also known as Water Style.
