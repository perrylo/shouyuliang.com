						Liu He Ba Fa literally means Six Harmonies and Eight Principles. It utilizes the power of Xingyi as its center, utilizes the stepping patterns of Bagua for its turning and spinning, and utilizes the neutralizing power of Taiji for its variations. Its movements are sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. These movements resemble that of floating clouds, and flowing water that is sometimes calm, sometimes surging. Therefore, it is also known as Water Style.<br><br>

			   		Wuji is an ancient internal martial art form long veiled in mystery. A great number have had a mastery over it. Wuji means no extreme. It is before Tai Chi, the grand ultimate. The entire form of Wuji depicts a vivid story that embodies profound of people have long heard of; few, however, have ever seen it, and an even fewer Taoist and Buddhist philosophies; it is about how we cultivate our ‘original spirit’ following the course of the cosmos and harmonizing with the myriad of changes of the universe. The physical movements and training express the ancient Taoist physical form and its many applications as well as having an in depth understanding of the theories and philosophies of this art. Grandmaster Liang had performed Wuji in China 30 years ago. In 1985, he had again performed this form at the First International Wushu Invitational Competition held in China. Anyone interested in martial arts, Qigong or Taoist and Buddhist philosophies will find Wujiquan unique and fascinating. Beginner and advanced practitioners are all welcome to attend. The system integrates the essence of soft and hard Qigong, it also emphasizes the cultivation of Qi, light, and spirit with the goal of reaching enlightenment.
