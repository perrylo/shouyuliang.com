			<h2>What is Taiji?</h2>
			<p><strong>Taiji (Tai Chi)</strong> is one of the major internal styles contained in Wushu. It was originally created as a martial art and the movements of Taiji contain martial applications. It utilizes the ancient philosophy of Yin-Yang and the Five Element theories for its foundation and to establish its training principles. The experience of hundreds of years has shown that practicing Taiji can improve ones health, reduce tension, and cure a number of diseases such as high blood pressure, arthritis, asthma, stomach ailments, heart problems and nervousness. The same techniques that were capable of developing internal Qi for martial arts combat, also proved to be effective as life prolonging, healing, and rejuvenating exercises. Today, Taiji is best known by the millions of participants around the world for its health benefits.</p>
			<p>There are many different styles of Taiji and a great number of Taiji Fist and weapon routines. However, the few major styles that have been recognized both in China and internationally are Yang, Chen, Sun and Wu style Taiji. Our school offers standard Taiji fist and weapon routines, as well as major traditional and competition routines such as Yang, Sun, Chen and Wu style. We also teach and explain the applications of Taiji movements, introducing and training Taiji Push Hands techniques such as the eight basic techniques, standard Push Hands routines, Free Push Hands etc.</p>
			<h2>Why learn Taiji? Who Should take this class?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Best for people over 16 years of age who are looking for low-intensity fitness training.</li>

				<li>For people who wish to improve their health, fitness level, ability to focus, balance, flexibility, coordination, stamina, strength, body posture, power, and endurance.</li>
				<li>Taiji emphasizes a calm and peaceful mind. The practice of Taiji stimulates the central nervous system, helps to lower blood pressure, relieves stress, strengthens the immune system, enhances elimination of wastes and the circulation of blood, and channels the flow of Chi through the body's meridians.</li>
			</ul>
