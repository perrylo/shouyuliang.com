			<p>Before moving on these basic exercise, please be sure to have learned and practiced well the forward front kick.</p>
			<h4>Angled Front Kick</h4>
			<p>This kick is basically the same as the Forward Front Kick, but instead of bringing the kicking foot towards your forehead, you bring your kicking foot towards the opposite side of your head (Figures 2-5 and 2-8).</p>
			<P><img src="../../images/newsletter/v3n5/a6p1.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="201" alt="Basic Kicks"></P>
			<h4>Side Front Kick</h4>
			<p>Start with your right foot forward and arms extended forward and back.  Turn your right foot out about 30 degrees.  Shift your weight onto your right foot and kick your left leg up as high as you can without bending your kneed.  At the same time, bring your left hand next to your right shoulder and extend your right arm up over your head (Figures 2-9 and 2-10).</p>
