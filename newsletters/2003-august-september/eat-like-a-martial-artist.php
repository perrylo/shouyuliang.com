			<p>The following are compiled excerpts from a book I am currently writing on martial arts diet and nutrition. This is not meant to take the advice of a qualified medical practitioner. It is simply my opinion and what has worked for me over the years.</p>
			<p>We in Western Society as a whole have lost touch with basic nutrition over the years. We live in a fast food society and take to heart the nutritional messages sponsored by large corporations. We consume too much sugar, meat, fat, dairy while neglecting fresh vegetables and fruit. We find organic foods to costly within our budgets while saving for a new $40 000.00 car. The answers to our health and nutrition needs are not 'super size it please'.  In my book I go further into detail about diet as well as training exercises and proper supplementation, all based on my actual use, not just medical studies done at a college by a doctor you don't know. Here are 5 ways you can start to change your habits for the better. As a martial artist, shouldn't you be a healthy person?</p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Drink More Water - 6 to 8, 10 oz glasses a day, spread throughout the day. More importantly, use the water you are drinking to replace soda pop (liquid sugar). Supplement with herbal and green teas as needed.</li>
				<li>Stay away from fast food burger-type joints. You know what they are without me mentioning them. If you are used to going to these places regularly then start by only going once a week.</li>
				<li>Eat whole grained breads, fortified with soy if possible. White bread is not good, stay away from it. Try and reduce your bread intake to 1 or 2 slices a day.</li>
				<li>Double the amount of vegetables you normally eat (if you are not vegetarian). Do not overcook them and try a variety. Use a multivitamin as well to make sure you are getting all the vitamins and minerals you need.</li>
				<li>Eat 1 vegetarian meal a week. Try it. You don't have to become a full vegetarian, I'm not. But it opens your eyes to the amount of meat we tend to eat at each meal. It really is ridiculous. If you are not buying organic meat you should know that the amount of chemicals in what you are eating is outrageous.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In conclusion, do some reading on the subject, educate yourself on what your body's needs are. Follow the path of moderation when eating and start off with small changes at first focusing on consistency.</p>
