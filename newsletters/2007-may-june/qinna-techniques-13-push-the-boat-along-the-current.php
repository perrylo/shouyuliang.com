			<h3>Push the Boat Along the Current</h3>
			<br />
			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the top with his left hand (Figure 5-66). Bend your elbow and circle up clockwise, at the same time, grab a hold of his hand from underneath with your left hand (Figure 5-67).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Slip your right wrist from his grasp and rotate your palm to grab his fingers (Figure 5-68). Rotate his arm and circle down to your left (Figure 5-69).</p>

			<p><b>Notes</b><br />
			A. Keep the circular momentum of your right arm when executing this technique. When you grab a hold of your opponent's hand, make certain that your fingers are hooked on the inside of his palm. This will give you a better grab and more rotation to create more pressure. If your left thumb is strong enough you should press your left thumb on the back of his palm at the metacarpal of the pinkie. This will give you even more leverage.</p>
			<p>B. When you grab the fingers of your opponent's hand with your ~ right hand, line up your pinkie with his pinkie and torque his hand clockwise. If your opponent's elbow raises up too much and he is able to turn his body around, check the angle of your push when you bring him down. Make sure that you are pushing him down at an angle to your left.</p>
