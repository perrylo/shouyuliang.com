			<h3>Bagua Zhuan Xuan Gong</h3>
			<br />
			<h3>Rotate Palm Posture</h3>
			<p><b>Verbal Secrets:</b><br />
			Roll, drill, struggle (i.e., expand and wrench), and wrap supporting eight directions.</p>
			<p>Rolling, drilling, struggling, and wrapping are the four most basic technical movements in Baguazhang training. Struggling (Zheng) here means to struggle against someone, or to expand and wrench forcefully. If you can master these four basic techniques, you can fight against the eight directions easily. The eight directions include the four sides and four diagonal corners.</p>

			<p><b>Movements:</b><br />
			<i>Left Rotate Palm:</i><br />
			From Figure 3-10, start to exhale and step about 15 degrees to your front left with your left foot. Put about 70% of your weight on your right leg and 30% on your left leg. Extend both palms forward and to your left (Figure 3-11). Turn your upper body to your left while rotating your palms out. Your palms and back heel should be almost aligned in one vertical plane. Point both index fingers up, while squeezing the other fingers in slightly, to create a bow in each palm. Focus your eyes in the direction of the index finger of your upper hand; complete exhale (Figure 3-12). Hold this posture and do eight abdominal breathing cycles. To complete Left Rotate Palm, turn your waist back until you are facing forward, while straightening your arms in front of you; begin inhale (Figure 3-13). Then bring your left foot back next to your right foot, lower your palms next to your abdomen, and stand up; complete your inhalation (Figure 3-14).</p>
			<p><i>Right Rotate Palm:</i><br />

Extend both palms forward and to your right (Figure 3-15). Turn your upper body to your right while rotating your palms out. Your palms and back heel should be almost aligned in one vertical plane. Point both index fingers up, while squeezing the other fingers in slightly, to create a bow in each palm. Focus your eyes in the direction of the index finger of your upper hand; complete exhale (Figure 3-16). Hold this posture and do eight abdominal breathing cycles. To complete Right Rotate Palm, turn your waist back until you are facing forward, while straightening your arms in front of you; begin to inhale (Figure 3-17).

			<p><b>Key Notes:</b><br />
			As your palms rotate out and back, they should have rolling, drilling, wrenching, and wrapping Jin. Rolling Jin refers to the rotation of your arm. Drilling Jin refers to the drilling and the extending of your arm. Wrenching Jin refers to the torquing and settling of your palms. Wrapping Jin refers to the wrapping action accomplished by squeezing in your pinky, the crest of your palm, and the base of your thumb.</p>
			<p>When holding this posture, pay attention to the Qi flow and the energization of your muscles. Every time you exhale, the Qi from your Lower Dan Tian should be lead out to your limbs, and should loosen up your limbs, one joint at a time. Your back should be rounded from the extensions of your arms; your hands should have the feeling of squeezing; and the center of your palms should have an expanded feeling. Your feet should feel like they are gripping the floor.  Breathing should be slow and regular. Don't breathe forcefully, or in a way that makes your body move excessively. Keep your head upright and your chest relaxed at all times.</p>
