			<p>Before continuing into section 4, you must be sure to have learned and practiced sections 1 to 3 correctly. As we continue the form, we are building a foundation with which many other forms and styles can be learned.  (From the end of "Grasp the Sparrow's Tail")</p>

			<h4>Single Whip</h4>
			<p>Shifting the weight to left leg, turn the torso leftward, looking to the northwest. Both hands brush leftward, left hand at shoulder level, right hand swinging down to waist level . The right leg turns inward, until the toes of the right foot point northwest.</p>
			<p>When weight is fully shifted left, left hand circles down, counter-clockwise, palm facing obliquely downward, and right hand circles upward, clockwise, palm facing inward, to face level. Turning the torso rightward, and shifting to right leg, both hands move to right side. Look to the northeast, so that the eyes are coordinated with the movement of the hands.</p>

			<p>As the left foot steps in to form a T-stance, the right hand forms a hook to the north-east, all five fingertips held together in a point, wrist bent so that the fingers point down, and elbow held straight, but relaxed.</p>
			<p>Stepping into a left bow stance to the west, the left hand circles counter-clockwise past the face, palm facing inward. Settling into the bow stance, the left hand twists palm out, sitting wrist, fingertips at nose level, elbow slightly bent. Look over the fingertips of the left hand. This completes "Single Whip".</p>

			<p>Shifting to right leg and turning the torso rightward, swing left hand down, counter-clockwise, palm facing obliquely downward. Turn the left leg inward, until the toes of the left foot point north, and look to the northeast.</p>
			<p>As the weight begins to shift back to the left leg, open the hook hand, and as the left hand circles upward, palm facing in, the right hand circles downward, in a clockwise direction, palm facing obliquely downward. The hands will pass each other on the forward-right side, with the left hand near the right elbow.</p>
			<p>Continue shifting to left, turning the torso leftward. Both hand move across to left side. Look to northwest.</p>

			<p>As the left hand twists palm out to circle down, counter-clockwise, and the right hand begins to circle up, palm in, step in with the right foot, both feet toes pointing forward. This completes one "Cloud Hand".</p>
			<p>As the hands continue to circle, left hand counter-clockwise, right-hand clockwise, they will pass each other on the forward-left side of the body, with the right hand close to the left elbow.</p>
			<p>Shifting to right leg, and turning the torso rightward, both arms move across to the right side, right hand palm in at face level, left hand palm facing obliquely downward at hip level. Look to northeast.</p>
			<p>Once turned fully to the right, twist right hand palm out, and step out with the toes of the left foot, toes pointing north.</p>
			<p>As the hands continue to circle, left hand counter-clockwise, right-hand clockwise, they will pass each other on the forward-right side again.</p>
			<p>Continue the pattern until the right foot has stepped in a total of three times. This completes the "Cloud Hands" section.</p>

			<h4>Single Whip</h4>
			<p>After the right foot has stepped in for the third time, shift weight to the right leg, while turning the torso rightward. The hands continue to circle as in the "Cloud Hands".</p>

			<h4>High Pat on Horse</h4>
			<p>Shifting weight to left leg, open the hook hand and take a half step up with the right foot (toes point to north-west). Turning to look over the right hand, shift onto the right leg, both hands twisting palms up.</p>
			<p>Bending the right elbow so that the hand is close to the ear, lift left knee. As the toes of the left foot touch down lightly to form an empty stance, the right hand pushes from the ear to the west, sitting wrist, fingertips in line with the nose, and the left hand draws in, palm up, to the dantian. This completes "High Pat on Horse" and Section Four.</p>
