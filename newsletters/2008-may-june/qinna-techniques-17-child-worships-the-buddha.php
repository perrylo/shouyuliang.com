			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right shoulder with his left hand (Figure 5-79). Lock his hand in place with your left hand and swing your right arm over his forearm (Figure 5-80).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Hook back slightly with your elbow and press your upper arm down on his	 wrist (Figure 5-81).</p>
			<p>Note:</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Keep a strong lock on your opponent's hand, but don't try to pull his hand off your shirt. His hold on your shirt becomes part of your lock on his wrist.</li>
				<li>When you swing your arm over your opponent's arm, raise your arm slightly to rotate the edge of his palm to face upward. This will create a painful wrist lock.</li>
				<li>If you are unable to create enough pressure for your opponent to go down, it is probably because the inside edge of his palm is not facing up. You may need to raise your right arm higher to lift the edge of his palm upward before hooking your elbow down.</li>
