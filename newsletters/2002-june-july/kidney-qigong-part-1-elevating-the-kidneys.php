			<p>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the kidneys are in charge of growth, development, reproduction, urinary functions, and store the <i>essence-of-life (jing)</i>.  The kidneys not only have a leading role in maintaining the fluid balance of the body, but are also responsible for the condition of the bone and marrow, activities of the brain, and hearing.  This is based on the belief that bones are nourished by <i>jing</i> which is derived from the kidneys. The kidneys are the foundation of one's innate constitution and physiologically relate to one's memory and will.</p>
			<p>Normal kidney function can also be affected by excess fear.  The kidneys have their specific opening in the ears.  Therefore, healthy kidneys can ensure good hearing.  Kidneys also have their specific openings in the urinogenital orifice and the anus.  Therefore, chronic diarrhea, urinary problems, and premature ejaculations are also related to the condition of the kidneys.  A darkening of one's complexion is usually seen in severe and chronic cases of blood stasis, accompanied by chills, and lowered vital functioning of the kidneys.</p>
			<p>TCM also states that if either the kidneys, lungs, or spleen are deficient in <i>vital-qi</i>, then the <i>guardian-qi</i> (energy field on the surface of the body) will also be deficient.  The body's immunity will be reduced and begin to affect other organs.  About 400 years ago, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD), medical expert Dr. Qi Shi said, "Curing a deficiency starts from the three roots: kidneys, lungs, and spleen."  A deficiency in <i>kidney-jing</i> will affect your growth and development of your body.  A deficiency in <i>kidney-qi</i> will also affect your hearing and cause a shortness of energy.  The improper regulation of sexual activities will deplete your <i>jing</i> and cause eventual loss of sexual organ function and frequent urination will occur.  If you are deficient in <i>kidney-yin</i>, your vision will deteriorate; and dizziness, ringing in the ears, weight loss, sweating during sleep, and/or nocturnal emission will occur.</p>
			<p>If you are deficient in <i>kidney-yang</i>, then your <i>life-fire</i> will be deficient.  Your vitality of spirit will be low, you'll tire easily.  Your limbs may get cold and you may be afraid of cold.  There may be pain and coldness in you waist area.  Men may not be able to get an erection.  Women may feel coldness in their womb.</p>
			<h3>Part 1.  Elevating the Kidneys</h3>
			<p>This technique is especially good for curing an inflammation of the urinary bladder, kidney stones, urine containing blood, womb bleeding, frequent urination, and nocturnal emission.</p>
			<h4>Preparation and Movments:</h4>
			<p><b>Step 1.</b>  Sit straight with your feet touching the floor about a shoulder width apart.  Sit with only one-third of your hips on the chair.  Don't lean back on the chair with your back.  Place your hands naturally on top of your keens (Figure 1-14).</p>
			<p>As an alternative, you man stand with you feet shoulder width apart and with your hands overlapping on your dantian (Figure 1-15).</p>

			<p><b>Step 2.</b>  Place your mind at you <i>huiyin</i> area.  Exhale slowly, draw in and hold up your <i>huiyin</i> area slightly.  Inhale slowly and release the <i>huiyin</i> area as you push your stomach out.</p>
			<p><b>Key Points:</b></p>
			<ol>
			  <li>The <i>huiyin</i> area refers to the testicles, vas deferens, penis and the anus muscles for men; the vulva, vagina, clitoris, and the anus muscles for women.</li>
			  <li>This technique can be trained at any time.  However, do not train more than 20 repetitions at a time.  After each set, rest for a while before repeating the training.  Too many repetitions at one time may cause dizziness for some people.</li>
			  <li>People with high blood pressure should rest after every 5 repetitions, before resuming the training again.</li>
			  <li>People that have a hard time falling asleep should avoid training this technique at night.</li>
