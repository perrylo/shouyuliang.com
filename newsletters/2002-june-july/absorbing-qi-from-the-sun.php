			<p>Nature contains a tremendous amount of strong qi sources.  The mountains, rivers, oceans, the sun, the moon, the stars, trees, flowers, and bushes, all contain qi that are advantageous to the human body.</p>
			<h4>Procedure:</h4>
			<p><b>Step 1.</b>  When the sun starts to rise over the horizon, extend one of your arms towards thesun,and point your index finger at the sun.  Look at the sun from your index finger to the sun.  While the sun is still red in color, focus on the sun as it rises completely above the horizon.  It is said that with this training, one will be open the <i>Heavenly Eye</i>.</p>
			<p><b>Step 2.</b>  After the sun has risen over the horizon and while the sun is still red, use one of your palms toface the red sun (Figure 4-87).  Allow the sun's qi to enter your <i>laogong</i> point.  The other palm faces down.  Allow the red sun's qi to continuously pass through your body and out of your palm that is facing down, for a few minutes.</p>

			<p><b>Step 3.</b>  Then use both palms to face the red sun (Figure 4-88).  Allow the sun's qi to enter both of your <i>laogong</i> points, passing through your body, out of your <i>yongquan</i> points, and into the ground.</p>
			<p><b>Step 4.</b>  When the sun has changed to a milky white color, turn your back to the sun and stand in acomfortable stance with your arms to your sides.  Round your back and arch your chest lightly to open your <i>mingmen</i> point (Figure 4-89).  When your <i>mingmen</i> point is <i>open</i>, the entire body will be <i>open</i>. With the sun shining at your <i>mingmen</i> point, the internal organs and bowels can be nourished and invigorated.</p>
