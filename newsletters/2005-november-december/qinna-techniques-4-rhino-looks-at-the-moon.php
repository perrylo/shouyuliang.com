			<p>Step 1.Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the top with his right hand (Figure 5-35). Step forward with your left foot and turn your body to your right. At the same time, rotate your right hand counterclockwise to your right to make his arm face up. Hit his elbow with your left forearm to assist the right arm rotation. Then clamp your left hand on top of his hand (Figure 5-36).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Lift up with your left arm, push down with your left hand, and press down with your right forearm (Figure 5-37).</p>
			<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
			<p>A. The deflection with your left forearm creates a rolling pressure that assists the right hand in turning your opponent's arm. Maintain a constant torque on your opponent's arm. This technique uses a seesaw like movement with your opponent's arm. The pressure you exert down with both hands is balanced by the weight of your opponent's body, and the pivoting point is his elbow.</p>
			<p>B. If your opponent is able to hit you with his other hand, you probably did not turn his arm enough, or you did not step far enough to his side. It is important that his arm is facing upward so that his arm can't bend at the elbow.</p>
			<p>C. If your opponent does not feel the pain, make certain that your left arm is pressing directly on the base of his elbow. Also, make certain that you are pushing up at an angle into his body, while maintaining the torque and pressure on his arm.</p>
