			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the top with his right hand (Figure 5-38). Step forward with your left foot and turn your body to your right. At the same time, rotate your right arm counterclockwise to your right to make his arm face up. Hit his elbow with your left forearm to assist the right hand rotation. Then strike to his ribs with your left elbow (Figure 5-39).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Take another step back with your right foot and move his arm over your shoulder. Clamp both of your hands on his wrist and pull down while standing up (Figure 5-40).</p>
			<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
			<p>A. When you rotate your opponent's hand to your right, you prevent his left hand from reaching you. Keep constant pressure on the rotation of your right hand. This will keep his arm straight and make the technique more effective.</p>
			<p>B. If your opponent does not feel any pressure and can still hit you with his left hand, wedge your shoulder up and forward a little more. This will lift his shoulder up to create the control.</p>
