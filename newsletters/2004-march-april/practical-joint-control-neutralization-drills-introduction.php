			<p>Before you begin practicing with your partner, make sure that you have a mutually agreed upon signal to let each other know when the technique is working. Excessive pressure during practice can cause permanent damage to your partner. Usually a slap with the other hand on your body or on the floor, or simply saying stop, is a good signal to your partner to ease the pressure.</p>

			<p><b>Step 1.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his right hand (Figure 5-1). Drop your right elbow slightly, rotate your palm to face you, then circle your forearm up clockwise (Figure 5-2). Rotate your right forearm and press the edge of your right palm on his wrist and cut down to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-3). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist, and let your partner practice this exercise.<p>

			<p><b>Step 2.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his right hand (Figure 5-4). Drop your right elbow slightly and press your forearm into his hand, while pulling your fist in, to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-5). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist, and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>
			<p>Repeat Steps 1 and 2. Instead of your partner grabbing a hold of your right wrist with his right hand, your partner grabs a hold of your left wrist with his left hand.</p>
