			<p>A left Spring Kick is accomplished by keeping your right foot on the floor, with your leg straight, but not locked. Lift your left knee up over your waist with your toes pointing down. Then snap your foot out until the power reaches to the tip of your toes (Figures 2-19 and 2-20). Your body is facing forward. This kick is also known as a Toe Kick. The kicking surface, however, is not the toes, but the top of the foot.</p>
			<p><b>Drill:</b> Start with your feet together and fists at your waist. Take a small step forward with your right foot and extend your left fist in front of you (Figure 2-21).</p>

			<p>After completing the kick, bring your leg back down by bending your left knee, keeping your knee above your waist, and pointing your foot downward. This completes a left Spring Kick.</p>
			<p>To do the other side, step down and forward with your left foot, shift your weight forward onto your leftleg and kick with your right foot. At the same time, punch forward with your left fist and pull your right fist back to your waist. Alternate from side to side across the length of the training area.</p>
