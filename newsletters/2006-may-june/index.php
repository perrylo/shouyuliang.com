				<p>This idiom implies that a temporary loss may turn out to be a gain.</p>
				<p>AN old man living on the northern frontier lost a horse.  His neighbors all came to console him.  But the old man was not worried at all.  "It may turn out to be a good thing," he said.  A few months later, the horse came back by itself and brought another fast horse with it.  The old man's neighbors came again to congratulate him.  But he was not overjoyed at all.  "This may turn out to be a disaster," said he.  One day, the old man's son went out riding on the fast horse.  The horse ran too fast, and his son fell down and broke his leg.  The old man's prediction proved to be right.</p>
