			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the bottom with his right hand (Figure 5-45). Circle your arm down clockwise and push his elbow to your right with your left hand (Figure 5-46).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Push his arm behind his back with his fist pointing up and squeeze his arm between your hands and chest (Figures 5-47 and 5-47R).</p>
			<p>Note: As you push your opponent's arm back, rotate your right wrist up slightly to make his fist point up. When you squeeze his arm, lift up slightly with your hands.</p>
