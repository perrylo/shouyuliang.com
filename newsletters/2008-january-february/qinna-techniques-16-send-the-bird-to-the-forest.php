			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the bottom with his left hand (Figure 5-76).	Figure 5-78 Circle your right arm counterclockwise to your right and grab a hold of his hand with your left hand from underneath (Figure 5-77).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Twist his fingers counterclockwise with your left hand, push up with your right hand on his fingers, and lift his arm up (Figure 5-78).</p>
			<p>Note:</p>
			<p>A. Maintain a constant rotation on your opponent's arm. Before you push up, lower his left hand slightly until it is lower than his elbow to create better control. This is especially important if your opponent is much taller than you.</p>
