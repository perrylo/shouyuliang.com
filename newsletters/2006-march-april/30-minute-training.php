			<p>I would like to share an e-mail Question and Answer that I hope you may find helpful. Thanks to "Greg" for the inquiry! - This has been edited somewhat to better fit the newsletter.</p>
			<p>Q. "Recently I have found it hard to practice consistently because I feel have so much to work on and too many outside activities.  Sometimes I get so busy I can only squeeze a half hour to practice.  What kind of daily half hour workout would you recommend? Should I practice just forms one session, work on kicks on another, punches, etc. or add a little of all of it in each half hour? I would appreciate the help because until my schedule clears up, I'm going to be swamped with work but don't want to have my skills deplete."</p>
			<p>A. Ah Yes!  Time...and how to train in limited amounts of it. Good Question!  Many possible answers...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can train like you say - something different to focus on in each training session.</li>
				<li>You can train like you feel (except lazy of course) - instinctive training, this usually develops best after some years of training experience have been accumulated.</li>
				<li>You can focus on your current class needs and train accordingly.</li>
				<li>You can focus on your weak points and strengthen them.</li>
				<li>etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Consider putting together a little "Circuit Training" routine for yourself.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p>20 minutes of your 30 is devoted to a non-stop circuit of stations.<br />10 minutes of your 30 is devoted to aquick Warm-Up, Cool-Down, and Special Needs.</p>
			<p>For the 20 minutes, this sample circuit is for 2 minutes each station:<br />(You can also do 20 one-minutestations, or vary according to "YOUR" needs).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Push Ups</li>
				<li>Squats</li>
				<li>Punching</li>
				<li>Kicking</li>
				<li>Horse Stance</l>
				<li>Jumps</li>
				<li>Heavy Staff Turning with footwork</li>
				<li>Shadow Boxing</li>
				<li>Sprinting on the spot knees high as you can as fast as you can</li>
				<li>Splits</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Followed by Special Needs:<br />Special Needs can be anything from a form, a weapon, skills, punching,kicking - you name it - for improving on your current (class) requirements.</p>
			<p>I'm sure you get the idea. Use your knowledge to Tailor Fit the workout for YOU!</p>
			<p>Enjoy! Have Fun! Happy Training!</p>
