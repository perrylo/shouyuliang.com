	        <p>This technique takes in the <I>pure essence</I> of the universe; and supplements the innate essence in your kidneys.  This solidifies the foundation of life and strengthens your <I>jing</I>.</p>
			<h3>Movements and Intention:</h3>
			<p><b>Step 1.</b><br />
			Sit straight with your feed touching the floor about a shoulder width apart.  Sit with only one-third ofyourhipson the chair.  Don't lean back on the chair.  Place your hands naturally on top of your knees as in Figure 1-14.</p>
			<p><b>Step 2.</b><br />
			Breathe naturally until your <I>dantian</I> is full of qi.  Exhale slowly, draw in your abdomen and <I>hold up</I> the <I>huiyin</I> area slightly.  At the same time, lead the qi from your <I>dantian</I< to your coccyx and up to your <I>mingmen</I> point, then separate into tow paths around your waist and meet at your navel.</p>
			<p>Inhale slowly and release the <I>huiyin</I> area as you push your stomach out.  At the same time,leadthe qi from your navel to your <I>dantian</I>.</p>

			<b>Key Points:</b>
			<ol>
			  <li>The <i>huiyin</i> area refers to the testicles, vas deferens, penis and the anus muscles for men; the vulva, vagina, clitoris, and the anus muscles for women.</li>
			  <li>This technique can be trained at any time.  However, do not train more than 20 repetitions at a time. After each set, rest for a while before repeating the training.  Too many repetitions at one time may cause dizziness for some people.</li>
