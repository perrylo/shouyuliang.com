				<p>The school has recently been receiving more email in regards to learning with Master Liang and his instructors.  There is undoubtly wide interest in Chinese internal martial arts for its healing and empowering capability, and also Wushu and Sanshou for their fitness and self-defence benefits.  As more people begin to participate in a new martial arts program, it is important to remember that learning is completely the responsibility of the student.  In this context, the student must ensure that he or she not only recognizes the methods but also understands the methodology.  The lessons of external forms are incomplete without first understanding the application of each movement, for example.  Likewise, practicing internal meditative exercises to relax only gives half the training value if you do not permit yourself to explore the passing feelings and insights you may encounter.  Of course, learning ultimately involves growing and the improvement of one's self.  As Yin is empty without Yang, so are internal martial arts without external.  Learning involves new forms and styles to compliment those you already know, and conscious efforts to remain unstagnant.</p></td>
