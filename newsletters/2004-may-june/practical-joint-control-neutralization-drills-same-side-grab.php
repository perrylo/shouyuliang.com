			<p>Before you begin practicing with your partner, make sure that you have a mutually agreed upon signal to let each other know when the technique is working. Excessive pressure during practice can cause permanent damage to your partner. Usually a slap with the other hand on your body or on the floor, or simply saying stop, is a good signal to your partner to ease the pressure.</p>

			<p><b>Step 1.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his left hand (Figure 5-6). Drop your right elbow slightly, rotate your palm to face you, then circle your forearm up counterclockwise (Figure 5-7). Rotate your right forearm and press the edge of your right palm on his wrist and cut down to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-8). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>

			<p><b>Step 2.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his left hand (Figure 5-9). Bend your elbow and press your forearm into his hand, while pulling your arm away, to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-10). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>

			<p><b>Step 3.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his left hand (Figure 5-11). Circle your arm up counterclockwise up (Figure 5-12). Open your hand and press the space between your index finger and thumb into his forearm as you turn your body to your left, to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-13). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>
			<p><b>Step 4.</b></p> Repeat Steps 1 to 3. Instead of your partner grabbing your right wrist with his left hand, your partner grabs a hold of your left wrist with his right hand.</p>
			<p>Being happy and laughing a lot also circulates Qi in the body.  As the saying goes: prevention is better than cure. So, exercise, be happy and stay healthy.</p>
