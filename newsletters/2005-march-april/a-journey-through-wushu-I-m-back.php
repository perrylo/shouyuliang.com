			<p>Hooray! I'm gonna welcome myself back to wushu okay. It's about time! March is here and I'll be at class this coming Friday. It really doesn't help that I'm so nervous after being away so long. I have a lot of catch up to do that's for sure. It took me awhile to gain my confidence again and push myself back into beginning to train again. I was hesitant because I haven't done it in awhile but slowly and one step at a time I am taking baby steps to re-integrate myself back into wushu. I've started my yoga training, I'll be back to wushu on Fridays, and soon on Saturdays, and just one step at a time until I find myself training wushu, sanshou, and core conditioning everyday as is my goal, to reach my ultimate goal. It took me awhile because I want to make sure that when I come back, I am coming back for good. This is going to take hard work to regain what I have lost and lots of focus so wish me luck! I'm going to feel soooo new again!</p>
			<p>I am looking forward to seeing all my wonderful instructors, fellow students, and friends again! I will work hard and will have much to say in my next article in May! Thank you!!!!!!</p>

			<p>Only time will tell the strength of my willpower.</p>
