			<p>From the art of Bagua, one of the great lessons I have learned and keep learning is that of "Change".Lifeis "Change". BaGua is "Change".  Changing with the changes is the perpetual philosophy.  Overlooking small, steady, daily life changes is normal, we generally need to feel secure and that life has a measure of constancy.  Abrupt, quick, major life changes can be overwhelming and even debilitating.   However our practice of the martial and health art BaGuaZhang, can help prepare us to deal with the challenges and adversities that come our way.  Our study and understanding of the BaGua theory, principles and philosophy grounds our mental, emotional, and psychological natures.  Plus the practice & study is fun.</p>
			<p>If great change is occurring in your life, remember your practice, take it one step at a time, focus,and get backto basics.  You need to take care of yourself in a balanced way. Changing with the changes, learning, growing, and loving as best as you are able. Using righteous and virtuous energy to dissolve any harmful forces. Tuning in to nature and humbly seeking the truth residing within.  "Physician Heal Thyself" comes to mind. Once you've embarked on your decisive course of action, the one you found to be right for you at present, keep an eye on the changes taking place. Then again, "Change with the changes".</p>
