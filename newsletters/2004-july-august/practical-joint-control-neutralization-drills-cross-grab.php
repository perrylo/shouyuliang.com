			<p>Before you begin practicing with your partner, make sure that you have a mutually agreed upon signal to let each other know when the technique is working. Excessive pressure during practice can cause permanent damage to your partner. Usually a slap with the other hand on your body or on the floor, or simply saying stop, is a good signal to your partner to ease the pressure.</p>

			<p><b>Step 1.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his right hand from the bottom (Figure 5-14). Press your forearm down on his hand and push down, to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-15). Repeat 10 times, then grab your partner's wrist and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>
			<p><b>Step 2.</b> Your partner grabs a hold of your right wrist with his right hand from the bottom (Figure 5-16). Circle your right arm down counterclockwise to your right and press into his hand with your forearm, to neutralize the grab (Figure 5-17). Repeat 10 times then grab your partner's wrist and let your partner practice this exercise.</p>
			<p><b>Step 3.</b> Repeat Steps 1 and 2. Instead of your partner grabbing your right wrist with his right hand, your partner grabs a hold of your left wrist with his left hand.</p>
