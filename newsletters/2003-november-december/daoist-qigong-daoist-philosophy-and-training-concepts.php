			<p>Aside from Medical Qigong, other Chinese societies have also made important contributions to the development of qigong. The most widely acclaimed high level qigong achievers are among the Daoist (Taoist), Buddhist, and Wushu (martial arts) societies.  In the second part of Qigong Empowerment, we focus on Daoist Qigong methods. We discuss both the longevity training, as well as, the higher spiritual purposes of their training. However, our training focus will be on health, healing, and longevity. Since a healthy body is the first stepping stone towards higher spiritual development, individuals interested in pursuing higher spiritual goals will find this qigong training very helpful.</p>
			<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Daoism mutually inherited, influenced, and further developed qigong from each other, both in theory and in practice. The oldest and most influential Chinese medical text, the Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic, is also one of the most important Daoist Cannons. They both believe in the unity of human (Small Cosmos) and heaven (Great Cosmos), the Five Element Theory, the Yin-Yang Theory, the qi meridians, and physiological functions of the organs. These are just some of the many common values between TCM and Daoism. Many of the basic concepts on healing and health are the same. However, due to the differences in their objectives, many of the commonly used terms have different implications.</p>
			<p>After thousands of years of searching for longevity and immortality, Daoist masters developed many healing, life prolonging, and spiritual cultivation methods. Their effective, profound, and esoteric cultivation resulted in many qigong techniques that can be used for health, healing, and longevity exercises for the lay person; and enlightenment training for individuals in search of higher spiritual realization.</p>
			<p>Dao (Tao) was a term used by all the schools of thought in China before the later Han Dynasty (25- 220 A.D.).It is a philosophy and science resulting from human's primordial need to find their place in the Great Cosmos. Dao was used as the universal term to describe the philosophy and theory of all schools of thought. Dao was also used to teach their philosophy and theory. It is loosely translated in the English language as the Way.</p>
			<p>Daoism refers to both the Daoist School of Thought and the Daoist Religion. The term for teach inChinese is jiao,which is the same character used for religion Before the Later Han Dynasty, daojiao literally meant use the Dao to teach, not Daoist Religion. After the Later Han Dynasty, the teachings of the Daoist School of Thought were combined with ancient Chinese religion and became Daoist Religion.</p>
