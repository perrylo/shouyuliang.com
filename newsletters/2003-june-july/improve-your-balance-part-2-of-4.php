			<p><b>5) Balance while leaning back and extending one leg forward</b><br />Drill 1: Balance on your right leg while leaning your body back and extending your left leg forward.  Keep your body and the extended leg straight.  Stretch your arms to your sides to help with your balance (figure 1-165).  Hold this posture for 10-30 seconds, then change sides.</p>
			<p>Drill 2: Same as Drill 1, except extend your leg up as high as you can.  Hold this posture for a few seconds (figure 1-166).  Then bring the extended leg down and repeat a few more times.  Next, repeat a few times on the other side.</p>
