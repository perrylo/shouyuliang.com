			</div>
			<h4>Movement:</h4>
			<p>Stand naturally upright. Inhale and bring your hands next to your shanzhong point, with your palms facing up and fingers pointing at each other (Figure 1-51). Exhale and rotate your right palm out and up, and rotate your left palm in and down; then extend both hands up and down (Figure 1-52).</p>
			<p>Then inhale and bring both hands down facing each other at your shanzhong point. Next rotate your left palm out and up, and rotate your right palm in and down. Then extend both palms up and down and exhale as you did on the other side. Repeat a total of 6 inhalations and exhalations.</p>

			</div>
			<h4>Intention:</h4>
			<p>Use Drawing 1-13 as a reference. During inhalation, use your mind to lead the qi from your yinbai point on your big toe, the beginning of the Spleen Channel, to dadu, to gongsun, to sanyijiao, to xuehai, to jimen, along the inside of your leg, and up to your spleen.</p>
			<p>When exhaling, use your mind to lead the impurities from your spleen out, passing your zhourong point towards your daboa point. When exhaling make a Hu sound; while drawing your stomach in and holding up your huiyin area, squeeze out the impurities from your spleen.</p>
			<h4>Key Points:</h4>
			<p>This technique is also effective without using your intention, provided that you hold up your huiyin area and draw in your abdomen to squeeze out the impurities from your spleen.</p>
