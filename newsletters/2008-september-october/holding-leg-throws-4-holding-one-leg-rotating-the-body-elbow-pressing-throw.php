			<h3>Holding Leg Throw #4 - Holding One Leg, Leg Blocking Throw</h3>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Gray throws a right round house kick to White's left. White bends his left arm so his elbow points out. White's right arm leans against his upper left arm and the right palm faces outward to block Gray's kick. This is called Palm and Elbow Crossing Method (Figure 4-12).</li>
				<li>White then turns his left hand outward and upward and tightly holds Gray's leg. White steps forward with his right foot and puts it next to Gray's left foot, and uses his right hand to block Gray's right hand (figure 4-13).</li>
				<li>With his left foot, White steps behind the right leg. White turns quickly to the left and uses his right elbow to press against Gray's thigh to make Gray twist and fall. (Figure 4-14)</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>Key Points</b></p>
			<ul style="list-style:disc">
				<li>When stepping behind your right foot, keep his right leg tightly locked and pull it towards the rear left corner. Your body weight should be more on the right leg to form a Bow Stance to keep good balance.</li>
				<li>Your right arm or elbow should press down on your opponent's leg to keep him off balance before the throw.</li>
				<li>When turning to the left, your body weight should shift from right to left as quickly and smoothly as possible.</li>
