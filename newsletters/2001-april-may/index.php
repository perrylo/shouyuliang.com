				<h3>Learning</h3>
				<p>"It does not matter if you have not yet started to learn something. When you have started, however, you must not stop until you really know it. It does not matter if you have not yet asked questions, but when you begin, you must not stop until the questions have been answered. It does not matter if you have not yet started to think carefully, but when you do, stop only when you have reached a conclusion. It does not matter if you have not yet started to discern something, but when you have, you must not stop until you are clear. It does not matter if you have not yet started to practice something, but when you do, you must diligently put it into practice."</p>
