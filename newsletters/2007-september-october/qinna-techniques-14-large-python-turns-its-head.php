			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the bottom with his left hand (Figure 5-70). Lower your right arm and bend your elbow over his forearm; at the same time, place your left hand over his left hand (Figure 5-71).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Grab a hold of his left hand with your left hand, press your forearm down on his wrist, and take him down (Figure 5-72).</p>
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When you bend your elbow, press your forearm into your opponent's wrist to neutralize the grab.</li>
				<li>Your left hand holds onto your opponent's left hand tightly, so that it can't slip off. Your right elbow circles in a counterclockwise direction over his arm. Once your elbow is over his arm, circle back and down on his forearm to lock his wrist. This is a wrist control, so you want to make his elbow bend. If his elbow won't bend, it becomes an elbow control.</li>
