			<p>This kick is accomplished by kicking with the top of the foot while slapping your hand down on top of the kicking foot.</p>
			<p>Drill: Stand with your left foot forward and your right foot behind. Bring your arms up over your head with your palms overlapping (Figure 2-25). Shift all your weight onto your left leg, bend your right knee slightly then kick up as high as you can. At the same time, slap down with your right hand on top of your right foot, and hook your left hand back (Figure 2-26). Put your right foot down and step forward and kick with the left foot in a similar manner across the length of the training area.</p>
			<p>As an alternative, you may do the drill by slapping down with the opposite hand (Figures 2-27 and 2-28).</p>
