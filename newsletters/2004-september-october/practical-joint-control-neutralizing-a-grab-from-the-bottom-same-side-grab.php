			<p>Before you begin practicing with your partner, make sure that you have a mutually agreed upon signalto let each other know when the technique is working. Excessive pressure during practice can cause permanent damage to your partner. Usually a slap with the other hand on your body or on the floor, or simply saying stop, is a good signal to your partner to ease the pressure.</p>
