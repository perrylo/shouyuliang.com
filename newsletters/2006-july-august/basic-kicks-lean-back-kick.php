			<h4>Lean Back Kick</h4>
			<p>This is a kick with the top of the foot or the toes.</p>

At the same time, extend your arms to your sides (Figure 2-41). Straighten your body and bring your arms and leg back to the starting position and repeat the kick several times. Then do the kick with the other leg.</p>
