			<h3>Green Dragon Turns Its Head</h3>
			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the bottom with his right hand (Figure 5-52). Circle your arm down counterclockwise as you step forward with your left foot, and hit his elbow with your left arm and raise it up (Figure 5-53).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Clamp your left hand on top of his wrist and pull down, while wedging your left shoulder up towards his shoulder (Figure 5-54).</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b><br />
			A. Keep rotating your opponent's right arm while keeping his arm rounded to maintain the lock on his shoulder. The raising of your shoulder and the pulling with your hands are in opposite directions to maintain maximum pressure on your opponent's shoulder.</p>
