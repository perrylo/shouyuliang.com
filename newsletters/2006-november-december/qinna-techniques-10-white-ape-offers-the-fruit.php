			<h3>White Ape Offers the Fruit</h3>
			<p>Step 1. Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the bottom with his right hand (Figure 5-55). Push your right arm towards his head, while grabbing his hand with your left hand and circling your hands down counterclockwise (Figures 5-56 and 5-57).</p>
			<p>Step 2. Push down and rotate your right arm to face up, while lifting your forearm up from under his upper arm. At the same time, step in with your left foot behind him (Figure 5-58).</p>
			<p><b>Note:</b><br />
			A. When you grab your opponent's right hand with your left hand, clamp your fingers on the inside of his palm and dig your thumb on the back of his hand. Then rotate counterclockwise. When you lift your right hand up, slip your right arm in while rotating your right arm to face up.</p>
