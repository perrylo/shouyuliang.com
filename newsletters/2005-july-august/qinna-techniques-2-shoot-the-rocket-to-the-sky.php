			<p><b>Step 1.</b> Your opponent grabs a hold of your right wrist from the top with his right hand (Figure 5-27). Raise your right arm up clockwise to neutralize his grab and press the edge of your right palm down on his wrist (Figures 5-28 and 5-29).</p>
			<p><b>Step 2.</b> Grab a hold of his right palm with your left hand from the bottom and grab a hold of his wrist with your right hand. Twist his arm clockwise and push it up (Figure 30).</p>
			<p>Notes:</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>This technique can be used as an alternative to Qinna 1 when the opponent's arm remains straight and you are unable to create the 'Z' angle required to execute the technique.</li>
				<li>The neutralization by your right arm sets up the initial rotation on your opponent's arm. In a flexible person, the rotation of your left hand may not be sufficient enough to create pain. In this case, you will have to take advantage and continue the pressure started by your right hand and twist more with your left hand. Your left hand may also grab his fingers instead, which will create even more pressure on him.</li>
				<li>If your opponent does not feel any pain, it is probably because you did not provide enough rotation with your right arm, and the left hand was not able to create enough torsion to cause the necessary pressure. Retry this technique and make sure you settle your right palm while neutralizing and maintaining the pressure with your left hand.</li>
