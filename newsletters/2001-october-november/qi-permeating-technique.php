          <h2>By Grandmaster Shou-Yu Liang and Master Wen-Ching Wu</h2>
          <br><br>
          <p>Qi Permeating Technique (<i>Quan Qi Fa</i>) utilizes the movements of the arms to assist in leading the qi throughout the body.  Its goal is to achieve a harmonious relationship between mind, body, and qi.  The movements of the arms are used to assist the mind in directing the circulation of qi.  The intent is to channel the pure essence of the universe into the body through the baihui point, and to drain out the impurities from the body.  Many older people often have energy pathways with qi that are scattered and unbalanced.  Their Upper Burner is too stuffy and has stagnating qi; and their Lower Burner is deficient in vital-qi.  The fist stage of qigong training is to reverse this condition.  That is, to raise the vital-qi and to eliminate the stagnate qi.  This will correct scattered energy and make it circulate smoothly in the body.  Qi Permeating Technique is an excellent way for the beginner to attain smoother energy.  Once the qi in the body is flowing smoothly, you will have a solid foundation for furthering your qigong training.</p>
          <p>When training Qi Permeating Technique, your sensations of qi will be heightened.  Sensations such as tingling, heat, slight sweating, or qi movements along the specific pathways, may be felt.  Most people will feel a warm or heat sensation.  Some people may have a cool sensation.  When you lead the qi down, you may also feel the bottom of your feet, the yongquan (bubbling well) points, have a sensation of heat or coolness.  These are all good sensations and are normal.</p>
          <p>Qi Permeating Technique is capable of smoothing out the channels in the entire body.  The goal is to have all the energy pathways flowing smoothly.  Once this is accomplished, all illnesses can be eliminated.  It can be trained while standing, sitting, or lying down.  The arms need not move during practice.  Simply use your mind to lead the qi as described.  Your breathing should be natural.</p>
          <p>Before learning this exercise, familiarize yourself with the areas involved in this exercise.  They are: baihui, on the top of your head; dantian, slightly below your navel; huiyin, at the perineum - the area in front of your anus; yongquan (bubbling well), two-thirds of the way up the center line of the foot from your heel; mingmen, on your back directly behind your belly button; huantiao, around the middle of your buttocks; and laogong, on your palm where your middle finger touches when holding a fist.  Once you have located these areas don't be overly concerned with pinpointing them exactly, during the qigong exercise.  What is important is to sense these areas with your mind.</p>
          <h3>Preparation and Movements:</h3>
          <p><b><i>Preparation:</i></b>  Stand with you feet shoulder width apart.  Grip the ground gently with your big tow and your second tow.  Place your palms naturally at your sides.  Bend your knees slightly.  Keep your body erect.  Your baihui, huiyin points and the midpoint between your mingmen points should all line up in a vertical line.</p>
          <p>Your nose and your navel should also be vertically aligned.  Relax your body, especially the huiyin point.  Close your eyes slightly, leaving only a small gap.  Stand like this and breathe naturally, until your mind is calm and your breathing is steady.</p>
          <p align="center"><img src="../../images/newsletter/v1n6/a1p1.jpg" border="0" alt="Qi Permeating Technique - Movements"></p>
          <p><b><i>Movements:</i></b> Raise both hands over your head, with your laogong points pointing at your baihui point.  Lower your palms in front of your body slowly.  Continue lowering your palms until they are next to your sides.  As you do the visualization described below, move your arms slightly ahead of the points or path of your visualization.</p>

          <h3>Visualization:</h3>
          <img src="../../images/newsletter/v1n6/a1p2.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Qi Permeating Technique - Energy Flow">
          <p><b>Step 1</b><br />
          <b><i>Front Path:</i></b>  Use your mind to lead the qi down from your baihui, imagine that the pure essence of the universe is filling your body.  Divide into two paths, down past your ears and meet at your throat.  Again, divide into two paths, down past your collarbones, to your nipples and meet at your navel.</p>
          <p>Continue down to your dantian and then to your huiyin.  Then separate into two paths, down the inside of your legs; imagining that all your stress and tension are being led down through your bubbling wells, and three feet into the ground.</p>
          <p>When your arms are hanging down naturally at your sides, relax completely from your head down to your toes (Relax your hair, forehead, back of your head, ears, nose, mouth, chin, neck, shoulder, chest, back, stomach, waist, thighs, knees, claves, heels, feet, toes, shoulders, arms, wrists, palms, fingers, and your organs).  Swallow your saliva and hold for 5-10 seconds in this relaxed state.</p>
          <p>Repeat Step 1, two more times.</p>
          <br clear="all">
          <img src="../../images/newsletter/v1n6/a1p3.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Qi Permeating Technique - Energy Flow">
          <p><b>Step 2</b><br />
          <b><i>Middle Path:</i></b> use your mind to lead the qi down from your baihui, imagine that the pure essence of the universe is filling your body.  Lead the qi through your head, down the middle of your body, through your organs and dantian until your huiyin.</p>
          <p>Then separate into two paths down through the bone marrows of your legs; imagining that all your stress and tension are being led down through your bubbling wells, and three feet into the ground.</p>
          <p>When your arms are hanging down naturally at your sides, relax completely from your head down to your toes (Relax your hair, forehead, back of your head, ears, nose, mouth, chin, neck, shoulder, chest, back, stomach, waist, thighs, knees, calves, heels, feet, toes, shoulders, arms, wrists, palms, fingers, and your organs).  Swallow your saliva and hold for 5-10 seconds in this relaxed state.</p>
          <p>Repeat Step 2, two more times.</p>
          <br clear="all">
          <img src="../../images/newsletter/v1n6/a1p4.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Qi Permeating Technique - Energy Flow">
          <p><b>Step 3</b><br />
          <b><i>Back Path:</i></b> Use your mind to lead the qi down from your baihui, imagine that the pure essence of the universe is filling your body.  Lead the qi down the back of your head to your neck, down along your spine, until your mingmen.</p>
          <p>Then separate into two paths across your huantiao; imagining that all your stress and tension are being led down along the sides of your legs through your bubbling wells, and three feet into the ground.</p>
          <p>When your arms are hanging down naturally at your sides, relax completely from your head down to your toes (relax your hair, forehead, back of your head, ears, nose, mouth, chin, neck, shoulders, chest, back, stomach, waist, thighs, knees, calves, heels, feet, toes, shoulders, arms, wrists, palms, fingers, and your organs).  Swallow your saliva and hold for 5-10 seconds in this relaxed state.</p>
          <p>Repeat Step 3, two more times.</p>
          <p><b>Key Points:</b></p>
          <ul type="a">
            <li>People who have high blood pressure shouldn't raiser their hands too slowly over their head, but should lower their hands as slowly as possible.  People with low blood pressure should raise their hands slower; but lower their hands a little quicker. People with normal blood pressure, should follow a comfortable pace.  As a general guide, the pace of your arm movement should be comfortable and slow enough to be able to sense the points with your mind.</li>
            <li>As an alternative, beginners may wish to simplify the visualization process into two stages in the following way:</li>
            <ul type="1">
              <li>Use your mind to lead the qi down from your baihui, down the Front, Middle or Back path.</li>
              <li>Next, relax completely from your head down to your toes, and imagine the pure essence of the universe is permeating throughout your body.  Then imagine all the impurities are draining out of your body.  Then imagine all the impurities are draining out of your legs through your bubbling wells, and three feet into the ground.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Breathe naturally; don't be concerned with abdominal breathing.  You may keep your eyes closed, open, or half closed during this practice.</li>
            <li>Each time, practice nine qi permeating cycles of one path.  When you are smooth with all three paths individually, you can practice all three paths together for a total of nine times, three times with each path.</li>
            <li>You can practice as often as you wish, morning or evening.  The morning, however, is the best time to practice.</li>
            <li>Don't practice when you are too hungry, too full, or too tired.  People with low blood pressure or who are too hungry, may feel dizzy during practice.  If this happens, stop training, sit down for a while, and drink some warm water.</li>
            <li>After completing nine cycles, raise your heels off the floor; drop them down, stomping the floor.  This will provide a gentle vibration throughout your body.</li>
            <li>When you hold for 5-10 seconds in a relaxed state, breath naturally.  As an alternative, you may place your mind on an area of your body that is ill to enhance its healing.</li>
