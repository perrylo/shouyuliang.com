	        <h2>By Tony Bujas</h2>
	        <br><br>
	        <p>Sit comfortably relaxed in a chair; with your back erect, and feet flat on the floor, your tongue is placed on the roof (palate) of your mouth. Breathe and swallow saliva naturally. Gentlemen place your cupped left palm on your Dantian and then your right hand over your left.  Ladies place your cupped right palm on your dantian and then your left hand over your right. Take a minute to physically smile and internally smile from the top of your head to the bottom of your toes, smiling within all your internal organs and into your bone marrow.  Think: <i>I am happy, I am relaxed</i>.  Next, direct your thoughts to your Yintang, (your light room), a spot right center (midpoint) between your eyebrows, just above the bridge of your nose.</p>
			<h3>Part 1: In Breath</h3>
			<p>Breathe <i>in</i> through your nose to the Yintang 36 times.  Just concentrate on breathing in and storing <i>"the best quality universal Qi"</i> in the Yintang.  Don't think of anything on the exhale.  (After you progress a bit, you can do 72 breaths, if desired).</p>
			<h3>Part 2: Out Breath</h3>
			<p>Breathe <i>out</i> 36 times, concentrating on the <i>out</i> breath only, while at the same time, you send Qi from the Yintang region throughout the whole body.  Don't think of anything when you breathe in.  What energy you stored in the Yintang in Part 1, you now send to your whole body, in this Part 2. (After you progress a bit, you can do 72 breaths, if desired - keep the same number of breaths in parts 1 & 2 and 3).</p>
			<h3>Part 3: In & Out Breath</h3>
			<p>Lie down on your right side facing a wall, in any position comfortable to you.  You can lie on your bed, on a couch, or on the floor. Now breathe <i>in</i> the <i>"best quality universal Qi"</i> to the Yintang and on the <i>out</i> breath, send this Qi down along your spine to your tail bone (coccyx).  If possible perform 36 to 72 inhale /exhale cycles  - depending on the number of breaths you did in Parts 1 & 2 of course.</p>
			<p>If you fall asleep in Part 3 before finishing the required number of inhale /exhale cycles, don't worry about it. It is good to fall asleep with this type of Qigong.  This keeps qi in your spine.  This Qigong is good for people who have weak kidneys and a low vitality.  Good for people who loose their essence.  It helps preserve the jing, the vital essence. (Works the root chakra, preserving the sex energy.)</p>
			<p>Pleasant dreams!</p>
