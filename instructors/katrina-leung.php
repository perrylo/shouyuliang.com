					<div class="article-content">
						<p>Katrina started Wushu at the age of 5 under the close tutelage of Grandmaster Liang and has become one of the school's finest and most famous athletes. Born and raised in Canada, she has been a national team member competing at world championships for ten years and trained with many revered Chinese martial arts masters such as Master Wu Bin (Jet Li's original coach) and the Beijing Wushu team, Master He We Qi in the United States, and Master Li Wen Qi in Toronto, Canada.</p>
						<p>Katrina has been featured in countless media: guest-starring in a Warner Brothers television show, appearing in a Women’s World Cup Soccer commercial, and being televised on ESPN and TSN sports networks. She has also been in Inside Kung Fu magazine, Qigong/Kung Fu magazine, and the Ming Pao newspaper.</p>
						<p>She is the lead coach for the youth and advanced athletes at the school. As a former high-level athlete she has the experience to nurture and develop future martial artists. Her goal is to actively promote the long-term growth of martial arts in B.C. and establish the infrastructure for practitioners of all levels to achieve excellence, both at high level competition and recreational levels. She is active in the governance and promotion of Wushu at the provincial, national and international levels. She is also a corporate finance and securities lawyer at a firm in Vancouver.</p>
