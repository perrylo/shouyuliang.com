					<p>Helen, the eldest daughter of Grandmaster Liang, has a long and enriched history within the school. Originally from Sichuan Province in China, she began training in traditional Wushu at the age of 4 under the strict guidance of her father. At the age of 11, she was chosen to train with Sichuan Provincial Wushu School. In 1985, she immigrated to Canada and became an official instructor at the Shou-Yu Liang Wushu institute in 1989.</p>
					<p>During her years of training, she has participated in many national and international competitions and has won a great number of gold medals. She has been featured in many media including Chinese Central Television(CCTV), Shanghai and Sichuan Provincial television in China, Cathay television in Canada, national pay-per-view features in the US, CBC and Channel M in Canada, as well as several newspapers and magazines in China, US, and Canada.</p>
					<p>At the school, Helen teaches most of the classes including both external and internal styles to beginners and advanced students. She, like her father, is an integral part of the school and imparts not only her finesse to the students, but also her confidence and strength.</p>
					<h4>Personal Words:</h4>
					<p><em>Chinese Martial Arts is a beautiful and profound art. It is the essence of Chinese civilization and is a major component of the Chinese historical, cultural, social, medical, and philosophical development. It is also a life nourishing, mental and spiritual training. I am who I am today because of practicing Chinese Martial Arts.</em></p>
