					<div class="article-content">
						<p>Mo has been with the Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute since 1993 and is one of the top athletes in the school.  Since the age of 12, Mo has had an obsession with hockey, and from the age of 16 he has been addicted to skiing and snowboarding.  Proudly Canadian, he follows the Vancouver Canucks hockey team zealously and spends every other winter/spring weekend in the famous local snow hills of Whistler-Blackcomb.  During most days, he is mild mannered Mo Fong Hui - programmer and trouble shooter for an IT department for a respectable financial institution.  At night, he is Mo Fong Hui, at Wushu, Iron Shirt Qi Gong, Da Pong Qi Gong, Bagua, Xing Yi, and Sanshoudo.</p>
						<p>Mo practices martial arts mainly for fitness and enlightenment.  He follows the teachings of Grandmaster Liang, that "a martial artist strives to be a true all around good human being and athlete, balancing both internal and external, and always a gentleman or lady in society."  His hope is to help Sifu reach his envisionment of a <em>Wushu Village</em>, and will endeavour to see this dream become reality with the best of his ability.</p>
						<p>Â </p>
						<h4>Personal Words:</h4>
						<p><em>'Nothingness' is the essence of Tao and 'Being' is the manifestation of Tao.  That which is there alone cannot be very useful unless both the states of what exists and what does not exist are combined.</em></p>
