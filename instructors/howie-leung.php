						<p>Howie is the older brother of Katrina Leung and teaches Wushu and Sanshou.  A grand-champion many times over in many past national and international competitions, Howie is a strict coach and formidable opponent.  He, with other fellow instructors at the institute, has been featured on TSN and ESPN in <I>Kung Fu Masters</I>.  He has successfully made the transition from Wushu to Sanshou competing, and is currently one of the school's top fighters and fighting instructors.  Besides Wushu and Sanshou, he also regularly practices Bagua, Xing Yi, Qigong, and Taiji.</p>
						<p>For Howie, Wushu is a great means to keep fit and its cultural and disciplinary principles are next to none.  His most interesting experience at the school was when he accompanied Grandmaster Liang back to China to visit Grandmaster Liang's hometown.  Having been born in Canada, it was a great opportunity for him to see China.  His hope for the Shou-Yu Liang Wushu Taiji Qigong Institute is that it becomes a national Canadian school, and a new world centre for Chinese martial arts.</p>
